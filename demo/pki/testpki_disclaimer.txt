This crude demo script is not to be used in production as is.
Its purpose is to take you through each step of the script, no more no less.

The script is set to run displaying commands, as indicated with a leading '+' sign. This is the actual command being run.

No worries if you see my root token ;-) But think twice when you do something in a sensitive environment.
